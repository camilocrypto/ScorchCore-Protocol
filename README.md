# ScorchCore-Protocol
ScorchCore is a deflationary NFT forging protocol for transforming idle Axies into productive assets. Using a "Burn to Earn" system, players create unique NFTs called "CoreMiners," collectible mining pets that mine $CORE tokens. Designed to create a sustainable and fair circular economy with robust anti-bot measures.
